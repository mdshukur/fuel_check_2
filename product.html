                        <h5>Biodiesel is a direct diesel replacement. Made from refined vegetable oil, biodiesel is a renewable, domestic, healthy, environmentally safe alternative to fossil fuels. It is biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-hazardous. Rudolph Diesel introduced the first diesel engine at the Exhibition Fair in Paris, France in 1898, fueled by peanut oil – the “original biofuel.” The gel temperature of biodiesel is about 30 F, so if you run it in colder weather you can “winterize” by mixing in regular diesel. For example, in Santa Cruz, running a B90 and RD10 blend (90% B99 and 10% RD or petro-diesel) will winterize the biodiesel. If you are going to Tahoe for the winter, I would suggest a 50/50 blend. (50% biodiesel AND 50% RD or petro-diesel). </h5>

                        <h1 class="my-2">Renewable Diesel (RD)</h1>
                        <h5>Renewable diesel is exactly the same as petroleum diesel but the feedstock is mostly plant-based instead of petroleum-based. Biodiesel and renewable diesel can have small amounts of animal oils and fats in them. Any diesel engine can run on renewable diesel with no modification. It has the same ATSM classification as petro-diesel and all-new diesel engine manufacturers approve of it being used in their engines. Like petro-diesel, the gel point of RD is around 0 degrees (F) and can be used to winterize B99.

                        <h1 class="my-2">Flex-Fuel (E85)</h1>
                        <h5>Over 20 million American vehicles, known as "Flex-Fuel Vehicles" (FFV) can run on E85 or regular, or any blend of the two. "E85" or "Flex-Fuel" means the fuel is 85% ethanol (grain alcohol) and 15% gasoline. FFVs have a green leaf on the back and use the word “Flex”. Also, the gas cap on Flex-Fuel vehicles is yellow. Technically, all gas cars built since 1985 can run on E40+ (40% ethanol, 60% gasoline) but this fuel has not yet been approved. However, there are signs things are slowly changing. We will lobby Sacramento to make E40+ legal for all consumers. All gas cars built since 1985 can be fully flex-fuel with an inexpensive kit. Ethanol was one of the first fuels used in the internal combustion engine beginning in the early 1800s. Gasoline wasn’t invented until 1891. Gasoline was a toxic waste product from refining crude oil into kerosene for lamps.
